Do you not like the way how the way Windows 10 works? Neither do I. Anyways, let's dig into the best tweaks for Windows 10 which are the best in my opinion, feel free to try it out for yourself. I'll keep updating this post later...
# 1. Removing all the modern/metro apps
Don't have a use for them? Well I highly recommend you do this "tweak", please note the following...
- You can't reinstall them later after they get removed
- This will not remove Microsoft Edge, the Settings App, and Windows Mixed Reality.
- Also, please note this will remove the Calculator and Sticky Notes apps in Windows 10.
- You'll gain 2 GB of space.

To do this, run PowerShell as an administrator then paste this code in:

#### ```Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -online; Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage```
# 2. Disable Cortana
Do you not like to talk to a personal computer assistant that collects from you? Neither do I. All you must do is go to group policy then Computer Configuration -> Windows Components -> Search -> Allow Cortana then set it to Disabled.

If you do not have Windows 10 Pro or above, you do not have Group Policy.
You can do this manually through the registry, though.
Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search` in regedit, and then create a new DWORD named "AllowCortana" and set it to 0.

Do you have any amazing tweaks you have for Windows 10? Feel free to comment below what tweak you have or edit this page on GitHub.
