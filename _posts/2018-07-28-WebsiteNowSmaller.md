Oh hey there! :wave:

I heard you might be low on bandwidth, aren't you? Maybe you won't, but starting now, this site eats less bandwidth. (And obviously, it's faster to load!)

## How? 
First, I have removed jQuery as it was used just for the hamburger menu.
The hamburger menu code has been replaced with a better code, without using jQuery.  
That's \~69kB smashed. I guess, if you used to have a 20MB data plan like me, and you valued each byte you have received, that's nice.

## Are you having any problems?
Everyone needs healing. If you notice any problems with the hamburger menu, go ahead and notice me using GitHub issues :)
