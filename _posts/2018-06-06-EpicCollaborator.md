# Epic's Introduction
I'm Epic, a Discord user since early 2016. I was a former staff of BPC and a developer in his team (BobDev) that has since been canceled in favor of GitCities.

I'm a bad web developer, decent in C# and know slight bits of HTML and JavaScript, as well as tiny bits of other languages.

I previously knew VB, which is the programming language [BShell](https://github.com/TheBobPony/BShell) was made in. Yes, I worked on that, and the project it was made for (although my additions never made it at all).

# Why I Was Invited to Be a Collaborator
Now, you might be wondering.
"If you're bad at web development, why are you a collaborator?"

Well, I'll show you why.

June 2, 2018. I decided to [fork the Bobpony.org GitHub repository](https://github.com/aepic999/bobpony.org) after finding a mistake in a post.

I posted a [pull request](https://github.com/TheBobPony/bobpony.org/pull/1) and it was merged not long after.

Same day, I posted [another pull request](https://github.com/TheBobPony/bobpony.org/pull/2) fixing a typo and it was merged.

And then, the day this is being posted. June 6th, 2018.

I was navigating through BobPony.org, when I saw that the [tools page](https://bobpony.org/tools) wasn't working properly.

After looking at the source and running the script that is supposed to put it there manually, it worked.

So, after that, I knew it was an ordering issue. I put the script after the <p> tag, and it worked.

I then sent [yet another pull request](https://github.com/TheBobPony/bobpony.org/pull/3) to fix this and it got merged.
Soon after, I checked Discord and I saw an image.

I was like "huh? what's this?"

I checked my GitHub notifications, and saw a notification. It said that I was invited to collaborate in the bobpony.org GitHub.
And here I am, today. I'm in the process of installing Jekyll as of me writing this post, so I can test the styling of the site.
I've also tried to give more recommendations since, but I don't know if any have made it in yet.
