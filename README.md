### Running locally for development
If you wish to contribute and want to test changes locally on your own system, here's how.

If you don't already have bundler, install it using [these instructions.](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

Once you have bundler, its a simple matter of running

- `bundle install`

to install all necessary packages, and then

- `bundle exec jekyll serve`

to host the website locally.
